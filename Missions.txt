Recent events have cause you to fall out of favour. You must work hard to improve your reputation.

-------------
When you become high enough rank, one of your rivals, usually the lowest, 
will begin threatening you and should you refuse to heed his demands he 
will commit treachery against you. However, keep in mind that you, too, can
 commit treachery against him. By taking the disguise of a poor ronin, you 
can head to their fief and choose either to incite his peasants to revolt 
against him or commit some manner of treachery against him. If you choose 
to incite his peasants to revolt against him you will be sent to kill his 
tax collector, which will set off a revolt. If you choose to commit some 
treachery against him, you can choose to commit treachery, which will lower
 his honor significantly, kidnap a member of his family to hold for ransom 
or to keep him from attacking you, or assassinate him. Failing in the 
former two will cause you to lose honor and land- failing in the latter 
will make your lord command you to commit seppuku, ritual suicide, or he 
will kill your entire family. So make sure you do not fail.

Treachery against the lord of this manor:
1)The daimyo has presented lordname with an heirloom sword; he will be expected to wear it when next he visits lord clanname. You plan to find this sword and take it. Anyone who sees you must die.✔
WIN: lordname has appeared at court without the heirloom sword the daimyo had presented him! He is dishonored.✔
2)An envoy from the daimyo is sleeping within. To bring shame to lordname, you must find the envoy, and kill him as he sleeps. No one who sees you can be allowed to live. ✔
LOSE: You have been captured in the house of lordname while obviously engaged on a mission of treachery. The daimyo has no choice but to order you to commit seppuku. You have until sunset to prepare yourself for death. ✔
(-> This adds 'commit seppuku' option to homecastle. If I go to the lord's house, he exterminates my family.)
-> When disguised, you can sneak into lord's manor and kill him. -> Everyone will know it was you, if you dont commit seppuku, so this will make all other Rivals attack you. 


-> Conquest Mode (as daimyo) similar to Risk - position armies in different territories - enemies will attack your territories on the edge - so strategic positioning will become equally important.

"One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind…the fact that he has to die. If he is always mindful of this, he will be able to live in accordance with the paths of loyalty and filial duty, will avoid myriads of evils and adversities, keep himself free of disease and calamity and moreover enjoy a long life. He will also be a fine personality with many admirable qualities. For existence is impermanent as the dew of evening, and the hoarfrost of morning, and particularly uncertain is the life of the warrior…"
