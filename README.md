# Fate of the Samurai

A few years ago I spent several weeks working on a Construct 2 game called "Fate of the Samurai". It in inspired in part by the wonderful classic Sword of the Samurai by MicroProse.

Parts of the project are in a fairly advanced state, but other parts still need a lot of work. Since I don't have the necessary time to continue it, I decided to post the current state of the project here.

The game is comprised of 4 projects:

1. The Meta-Game, which includes the map of Japan, the World Map and the family/rivals/story/quest logic and implementation. This one is in the most advanced development state - the logic is nearly finished as it is. The projects needs balancing, in parts visual overhauls and bug fixing.

2. The Battlefield Game, which allows you to control units of independent soldiers of different classes, in a Total War, 2D top-down style (see screenshot). The mechanics here are fairly advanced as well, with the positioning logic being as good as done. It requires samurai sprites for the units (which are already partially included in the Castle/Rescue Game mentioned below - I had someone do them for this project specifically). It also needs considerable fine tuning and balancing, better fight-logic, different starting scenarios etc. This part of the project also has the biggest potential for further improvement, like adding terrain as a factor for speed and strength, possibilities to hide in trees/fields etc. I had originally intended to make this battle engine a stand-alone game in itself - it still has the potential for it.

3. The Duel Game, which uses Spriter and features a side-view duel of samurai shadows. This requires lots of loving all around. 

4. And finally, a Castle/Rescue Game which entails a dungeon simulator and creates a different castle each time, from which you can save the princess/kill your rival/ etc. The castle generation, some logic and some AI is done, but I'd say this one needs the most work, still.

These are, as of now, separate Construct 2 projects that would need to be brought together eventually but should absolutely be enjoyable by themselves.
